# internal-zgui


Insanely horrible and un organized horribly made really shitty pasted internal base with zgui.

Base source: https://github.com/Android1337/Basic-Fortnite-Cheat-Source-Internal
zgui: https://github.com/zxvnme/zgui (best thing ever)
sdk and rendering framework pasted from: https://github.com/csgo/sdk

This most likely wont even build so youll prob have to fix some shit but its a start ig lol.
